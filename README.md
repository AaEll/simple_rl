# mdps
Some simple infrastructure for experimenting with Markov Decision Processes in python.

## Overview

tasks: contains implementations for a few standard MDPs

experiments: code for running experiments. runExperiments.py is the real meat: running that will autogenerate plots for a given set of {agents, MDP, parameters (numEpisodes, numInstances, etc.).

agents: code for some basic agents. More to come hopefully.
