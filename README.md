# mdps
Some simple infrastructure for experimenting with Markov Decision Processes in python.

## Overview

* (_tasks/_): Implementations for a few standard MDPs

* (_experiments/_): code for running experiments. runExperiments.py is the real meat: running that will autogenerate plots for a given set of {agents, MDP, parameters (numEpisodes, numInstances, etc.)}.

* (_agents/_): code for some basic agents (a random actor, _Q_-learner, etc.). More to come (hopefully).
